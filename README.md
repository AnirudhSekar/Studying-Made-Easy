This app is a React Native App built to optimize studying. 
Studying Made Easy allows the user to enter concepts in a flashcard-like manner, with questions and answers. From there, the program allows the user to test themselves on the concepts that the user wants to study. Being a student myself, many of the issues students face are in regards to studying are that they don't understand the concept and they don't study for an adequate time. Because of this, we have built two unique features to directly target this. The 2 most unique features of the app are the AI Assistant feature, which is an LLM that assists the user with any questions in regards to the topic, and the Reminder feature, which will prompt and send notifications to remind the readers of specific tasks so that they study for an adequate amount of time.
